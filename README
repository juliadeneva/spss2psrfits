This program converts data from DSS-28 Goldstone antenna to psrfits.

DSS-28 data is typically written as 8 separate files containing dynamic       
spectra as 8-bit values. The files have names iBOBX.spec, where X=0-7.        
Each iBOB may drops samples (complete spectra) occasionally. This program     
assumes that dropped samples are fixed/filled in.                             

There are also iBOBX.idx files. Each of these contains 32-bit integers        
that are sample sequence numbers. If there is a jump by 2 or more in the      
integer sequence, this means that a sample was dropped. This program does     
not read the .idx files, but they are necessary for filling in dropped        
samples.                                                                      
                                                                              
This program depends on an info.txt file in the same directory as the .spec   
and .idx files. The info.txt file contains basic pointing information like    
the source name and coordinates, and channel center frequencies for each      
iBOB.                                                                         

One or more iBOBs may be turned off. If data from one or more iBOBs doesn't   
exist, the weights of the respective channels in the output psrfits file      
are set to 0.0.                                                               

If the user decides to ignore data from one or more iBOBs even if the data
exists, the channel weights for channels from the ignored iBOB will be set to 
0.0.
